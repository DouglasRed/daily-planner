# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Decription

This work day scheduler is perfect for anybody that would like to take control of their working hours. Record your activities hour by hour to better manager your time during the day. You can plan out your tasks and activities for the day and watch as the calendar will let you know what you should be doing depending on the day. Feel free to leave and come back to your tasks still waiting for you, as long as you save all of your edits.
